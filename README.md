# SnakeGame
This is my first reverse-engineered classic game in Unity 2D: the classic Snake.

In this project, I learned the basics of Unity 2D, including:
-  Displaying objects and changing their appearances
-  Input from the keyboard and movement
-  Object location modification
-  Randomizing algorithms
-  Using the FixedUpdate() method for physics
-  Collision detection and triggers
